## Modelling the Current and Future Distribution of Hyperoceanic Bryophytes in the UK

## Description
This project was conducted to determine the current and future distribution of nine threatened hyperoceanic bryophytes within the UK. Each species was assessed to be threatened under the IUCN Red List or was part of the Section 7 protected species list as part of the Wales Biodiversity Partnership, which replaced Section 42 of the NERC Act (2006). The current distribution of these species was modeled under current mean annual climatic conditions within the UK, with the future distributions being modeled under future projected climatic conditions utilizing Shared Socio-Economic Pathway 3 (SSP3). Under this scenario, nations begin to turn inwards and focus on domestic energy and food security at the cost of global collaboration. Strong environmental degradation is predicted under this scenario.

## Requirements

This code required at least R version 4.2.2 and was written and run in R Studio. 

All packages used within the project are outlined within the respective .r file associated with the project (Current Distribution Model.r | FUTURESDMS.r). 

## Getting Started

To use the code, open one of the files (Current Distribution Model.txt / FUTURESDMS.txt) within R and run one line of code at a time as issues to arise when trying to run the entire code at the same time. 

## Collaborators

This project was assisted by both [Dr Penny Neyland](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/p.j.neyland/) and [Dr Miguel Rivera](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/miguel.lurgi/).
